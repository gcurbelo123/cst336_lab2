You ever wonder where computers come from? You have a wonderful 
piece of technology available to you, yet most people have no 
idea how it got to be what it is today. That's why I created 
this website! :) So, grab a snack, and let's talk history!

The early thought process behind computing systems dates back to 
the 1800s. An English mathematician named Charles Babbage 
designed the Analytical Engine that the basic framework of 
computers are built upon.
