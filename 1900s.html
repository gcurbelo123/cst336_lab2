                        The 1900s was a super huge time period in computer history. So many developments
                        came out of the 20th century. There was so much that happened, it would be crazy
                        to put it all.
                        <br/><br/> 
                        Alan Turing proposed the idea of the Turning machine, which would be capable of 
                        computing anything that is computable -- the concept of modern computers.
                        The first functional "modern computer" -- the Z1 -- was built by Konrad Zuse in 
                        Germany. Around the same time, J.V. Atanasoff, a professor at Iowa State Univ., 
                        attempted to build the first computer without gears, cams, belts, or shafts. 4
                        years later, Atanasoff and Clifford Berry designed a computer that could solve 
                        29 equations simultaneously -- the first time a computer was able to store info
                        on its main memory. UNIVAC, the first commerical computer for business and 
                        government applications was built by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Since computers were beginning to be made, programming languages had to be 
                        created in order to get the computers to do as we pleased. Grace Hopper 
                        developed COBOL, the first computer language. IBM then creates the FORTRAN 
                        programming language. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        Also during this time period, huge modern tech companies, and current 
                        technologies were being developed. In 1939, Hewlett-Packard (known as HP), was 
                        founed by Bill Hewlett and David Packard in a garage in Palo Alto, California.
                        Bill Gates and Paul Allen, after successfuly writing code for the Altair,
                        form their own company, Microsoft. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak create Apple
                        and present the Apple 1. In 1958, Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce unveil the computer chip.In 1983, Apple's 
                        Lisa is the first PC (personal computer) with a GUI. To respond, Microsoft 
                        released Windows.
