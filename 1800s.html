                        In the 1800s, not many things happened when it came to the actual technology itself.
                        The contributions around this time more had to do with abstract ideas and different
                        math processes -- which are a huge part of computers and CS.
                        <br/><br/> 
                        In France of 1801, Joseph Marie Jacquard invented a loom that used wooden cards to 
                        weave fabric designs. Now, this didn't necessarily enable computers to be created.
                        Early computers used similar punch cards.
                        <br/><br/>
                        In 1822, Charles Babbage pitched a project that was funded by the English government.
                        The project was a steam-driven calculating machine, that could compute tables of 
                        nubmers -- which is very similar to a modern day computer.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Then in 1890, Herman Hollerith designed a punch card system to calculate the 1880 
                        census. He would later establish a company that we all know as IBM.
