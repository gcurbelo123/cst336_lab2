                        In the 21st Century, computer development was more based around making computers
                        more efficient, portable, and user friendly. Technology just started to advance
                        at an exponential rate, and it still does to this day.
                        <br/><br/> 
                        Apple released it's extremely popular MAC OS X operating system. Microsoft would
                        shortly after roll out Windows XP. Eight yeras later, in 2009, Microsoft launched
                        Windows 7, which is still a dominant operating system to this day.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The technology started to get smarter and faster. AMD released the first 64-bit
                        processor. Apple released the MacBook Pro in 2006 and an iMac. The Nintendo Wii 
                        also is available at this time. The next year, Apple releases the iPhone, 
                        putting a comptuer in the palm of your hand. In 2010, the iPad was released.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Many popular technologies were also launched at this time. Facebook was founded 
                        in 2004, YouTube was launched in 2005. The Chromebook, launched by Google, which
                        runs the Chrome OS, was launched in 2011.
